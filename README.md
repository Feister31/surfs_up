# surfs_up_Analysis
### Overview of the analysis: The purpose of the analysis is the understand the relations between the amount of precipitation in a given length of period, the changes from year to year, and the average weather during a specific part of the season. 
### Results 
* The June temps shown here to indicate that the majority of the temperature revolves around the low 70's given that information. I would like to assume that the location selected for this analysis, Oahu is fairly much warmer than most states. Given its tropic location and season. Having a mean temp of 74 degrees with a standard deviation of 3.7 to round up. Likely, anyone who chooses to travel to Hawaii during December will encounter breezy, cool weather with plenty of sun coverage.

* Much like the June Temps, the December Temps showed to have very identical numbers. except for a slightly lower mean of temp being 71 degrees. Given the time of the year that it is. an average temperature of the '70s and above during the middle of December will likely attract travelers who are seeking alternative vacation plans being that most of the states will be in their coldest during the time.
### Summary 
For a surf shop to achieve maximum success and an ice cream shop to be sustainable year-round, the majority of the factor has to be in favor in term of the weather. While most travelers would likely try surfing during their time at the beach, there aren't many who will be trying something that new with unfavorable weather conditions. Seeing that the difference in terms of weather between the warmest part of the year and the coldest part of the year have only 3 degrees of drop. We can conclude that given everything else is the same, there is a good chance that the surf shop, as well as ice cream parlor, will do good business year-round.
